I'm a postdoctoral researcher at US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Agricultural Research Service (ARS). I earned my Ph.D. from [Oklahoma State University](https://agriculture.okstate.edu/departments-programs/afs/), where I focused on developing antibiotic alternatives through microbiome-based approaches. My current research continues in this area, focusing on improving animal health and disease prevention by exploring innovative microbiome-based strategies."


Profile of Qualifications
------
* 5 years of experience in bioinformatics and NGS data analysis and visualization, particularly with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and RNA-seq.
* Extensive hands-on experience in animal experimentation, with a focus on microbiome research and pathogen-host interactions.

Antibiotic resistance is a global challenge, driven by the transfer of bacteria and resistance genes between humans, animals, and the environment. This issue has prompted a [global ban on the use of antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20antibiotics%20for%20growth%20promotion%20purposes%20was%20banned,January%202017%2C%20through%20regulatory%20change). To maintain the sustainability and profitability of livestock and poultry industry, there's an urgent need for developing antibiotic alternatives. Manipulation of the gut microbiome is currently being actively explored as novel antibiotic-alternative approach. Utilizing multi-omics techniques and bioinformatics analysis, my research is dedicated to identifying microbiota or microbial metabolites with the potential to serve as novel antibiotics alternatives. My work is organized into following two main areas: 

* **NGS data analysis pipeline development and refining**: Developed data analysis workflows using Python and R for NGS data analysis, statistical computing, and visualization, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and RNAseq.  

* **Development of antibiotic alternatives through microbiome-based approaches**: Conducted multiple animal trials and microbiome research to identify microbiome or microbial metabolites biomarkers that could be developed as antibiotic alternatives.
