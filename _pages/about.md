I'm a Bioinformatics Research Scientist at the [IEH Laboratories and Consulting Group](https://www.iehinc.com/) in Seattle, Washington. I earned my Ph.D. from Oklahoma State University, where I specialized in integrating **wet-lab** and **bioinformatic**s approaches to develop **microbiome-based** alternatives to antibiotics. My current research integrates next-generation sequencing (NGS) and computational biology to address two critical challenges: the development of microbiome-based alternatives to antibiotics in poultry production, and the rapid detection of foodborne pathogens to enhance food safety.

Profile of Qualifications
------
* **Programming**: Python, R, SQL, Perl, Linux, Bash
* **Quantitative Bioinformatics Skills**: 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, bulk-RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), whole genome sequencing (WGS),CRISPR-Cas9 analysis, statistical computing, meta-analysis, machine learning in biomarker selection, database creation and maintenance.
* **Wet lab**: DNA & RNA isolation & quantification, gel electrophoresis, primer design, next-generation sequencing library prep, RT-PCR, bacterial isolation & culture, mammalian cell culture, animal handling (mice, rat, chicken).


Research Interests
------
* **NGS data analysis pipeline development and refining**: Developed data analysis workflows for NGS data analysis, statistical computing, and visualization.
  
* **Meta-analysis**: Downloading publicly available datasets and performing meta-analyses related to research areas of interest.

* **Development of antibiotic alternatives through microbiome-based approaches**: Conducted multiple animal trials and microbiome research to identify microbiome or microbial metabolites biomarkers that could be developed as antibiotic alternatives.
* **Development of Rapid Detection Methods to Improve Food Safety and Effective Foodborne Outbreak Analysis**: Integrates genomic analysis and computational biology to uncover pathogenic mechanisms, trace contamination sources, and develop targeted control strategies within the food supply chain.
