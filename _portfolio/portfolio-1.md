***

* Developed data analysis workflows using Python and R for NGS data analysis, statistical computing, and visualization, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and RNAseq.
  
* Created Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene Taxonomy Database: Conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 1,500 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing samples from chicken ileal and cecal gut regions using QIIME2. Integrated data from established databases (RDP, Greengenes2, NCBI, and EzBioCloud) to update the top 1,000 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), applying a 97% identity threshold to ensure relevance to poultry research. Developed Python and R scripts to automate taxonomy classification, facilitating efficient and accurate microbial identification for future research endeavors. <br>
