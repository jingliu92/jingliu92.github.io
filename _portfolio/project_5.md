Selected studies to which I contributed bioinformatics analysis:
1. Impacts of Fermented Red Ginseng (FRG) and Curcumin on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease [[Link]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/2/240). <br>
(Collaboration with Prof. Yoo Kim, Department of Human Nutritional Science, OSU)
* Conducted comprehensive analysis of microbiota and RNA sequencing data of multiple studies to explore the anti-aging effects of FRG and curcumin.
* Performed correlation analysis between differentially enriched bacteria and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), contributing to understanding the interaction between host and gut microbiota underlying anti-aging.

2. Alternative Solutions for Pathogens in Poultry [[Link]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579123005783). <br>
(Collaboration with Prof. GuillermoTellez-Isaias, Department of Poultry Science,University of Arkansas)
* Executed mutiple microbiota data analysis, focusing on identifying potential solutions to mitigate pathogens in poultry.
* Drafted reports for summarizing key results for each study.
