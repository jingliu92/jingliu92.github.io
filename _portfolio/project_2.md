*	Conducted multiple animal trials and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data analysis to investigate gut microbes that are associated with residual feed intake in chickens. Check out the published papers [here](https://jasbsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40104-020-00542-2).

*	Performed meta-analysis of publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequencing data to investigate the biogeography and succession of chicken gut microbiome.
